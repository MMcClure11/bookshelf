# The Bookshelf

This is the source code for a virtual library of all the books you want to keep
tabs on, those sneaky buggers tend to run off in search of adventure.

You can visit the live application [here](https://bookshelf-meks.fly.dev/).

This project’s origin is as the demo for [Meks’ talk](https://www.elixirconf.eu/talks/the-bookshelf-engage-your-users-with-liveview-and-tailwind-css/)
"The Bookshelf: Engage Your Users with LiveView and Tailwind CSS", presented at
ElixirConf EU, 2024.

## Development

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Run `mix setup` to install and setup dependencies
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
