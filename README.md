# The Bookshelf

This is the source code for a virtual library of all the books you want to keep
tabs on, those sneaky buggers tend to run off in search of adventure.

You can visit the live application [here](https://bookshelf-meks.fly.dev/).

This project’s origin is as the demo for [Meks’ talk](https://www.elixirconf.eu/talks/the-bookshelf-engage-your-users-with-liveview-and-tailwind-css/)
"The Bookshelf: Engage Your Users with LiveView and Tailwind CSS", presented at
